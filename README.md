### Webpage
- This is is the main repo that we should work on.

- It is 30% complete 
- I HAVE NO IDEA OF EXACTLY WAT THE WEBSITE SHOULD HELP SHIELD ANY IDEA IS VALID. My idea was that we build a strong and dynamic web site with almost every language .

- I have excluded mysql database but i will upload the image of the database name ,table and entities.
- We should first work on  removing bugs in HTML,CSS,Javascript(front end) JSON and ajax, and adding comments were possible we shall finish with PHP and the database.

- Any manipulation is accepted just little consultation this may include (FILE NAME,CSS COLOURS AND OTHER ATRIBUTES,JAVASCRIPT EVENT HANDLING AND OTHER FUCTIONS.

- I HAVE NOT RENDERED ANYTHING ON PHP PAGE HENCE ITS EMPTY WE SHOULD ADD CONTENT ON IT.

- I have pulled the JSON data  using ajax from unknown site so we need to host our own JSON and pull it the data in the json will bw discussed.

- We shall make everything in order before we make it public.
- Any other issue to be discussed I shield blacksite.
